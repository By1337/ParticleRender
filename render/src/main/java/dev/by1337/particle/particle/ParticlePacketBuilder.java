/**
 * Builder for constructing particle network packets.
 * <p>
 * This class handles the low-level encoding of particle data into Minecraft protocol packets.
 * It manages protocol version adaptation, VarInt encoding, and ByteBuf writing operations.
 * <p>
 * Users typically interact with this class through the {@link #append(ParticleData, double, double, double)}
 * and {@link #append(ParticleSource, double, double, double)} methods when implementing custom
 * {@link ParticleSource} patterns.
 * <p>
 * The builder uses a callback pattern where {@link #onWrite()} is invoked during packet encoding
 * to populate the packet with particle data. This allows for lazy evaluation and efficient batching.
 * <p>
 * <b>Internal API:</b> The {@link #accept(ViaHook.ViaMutator, ByteBuf)} method and internal fields
 * are part of the packet encoding pipeline and should not be called directly by users.
 *
 * @see ParticleSource
 * @see ParticleData
